This paper presents a Transformer-based deep learning framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to enhance upper limb motor control in neurorehabilitation. The model achieved 87.27% accuracy across varying levels of task complexity and controlled a humanoid robot to replicate subject movements. Results highlight the utility of EEG-EMG fusion for precise, adaptive BCI-driven systems.
