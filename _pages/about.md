I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the **University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)**, advised by Dr. Ramana Vinjamuri. My research lies at the intersection of **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), neural signal processing, and reinforcement learning**. I build real-time adaptive pipelines for motor intent decoding using EEG and EMG signals, with applications in assistive technologies, rehabilitation, and neuroadaptive gaming.

Before joining UMBC, I worked on gesture decoding systems for prosthetics and interactive virtual environments. My work emphasizes synergy-driven analysis, multimodal control, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.
